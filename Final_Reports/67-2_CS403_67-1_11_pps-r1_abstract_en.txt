Retrieval and Clustering of Academic abstracts using Natural Language Processing Techniques
This project aims to propose an approach to enhance the efficiency of 
search and clustering systems for academic research abstracts. The development 
leverages deep learning tools to categorize words based on their semantic similarity, 
enabling the system to perform effective searches without requiring users to input 
highly specific or domain-specific terms that are exclusively present within the 
abstracts. This approach aims to facilitate user accessibility and significantly reduce 
the time spent searching for relevant abstracts. 
In this project, the authors evaluated the search accuracy of four NLP 
techniques: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, and BERT. The evaluation was conducted by 
preparing a set of keywords specifically selected to correspond to a curated 
collection of 100 research abstracts. After generating embeddings for each technique, 
the keywords were used to perform searches against the dataset, and the accuracy 
of each technique was assessed based on the correctness of the retrieved abstracts. 
The technique demonstrating the highest accuracy will be selected for further 
development to enhance the performance and reliability of the abstract search 
system.
